# Community-Extension

## Calhacks Project

### Idea: 
Create a Chrome Extension that will bring together friends, families, and neibors as well as saving local businesses while social distancing. 
The emphasis will be on Digital Communication. 

#### Potential idea:
    -Chrome Extension that allows users to select/filter by groups (businesses, front-line workers, news, peers).
    -Each group will rate and save pages relevant to their interests and the user can filter the most popular pages visited by a chosen group.
    -The selling factor here is that groups can push relevant/important websites/information to other people in the same group with similar experiences.
        -i.e. I create three groups in my Chrome Extension and add friends accordingly to different groups (Business, Front-line workers, news, peers)
            -Each group will be rating pages they have visited, marking important information, etc.
            -When I filter by each group, I will be able to see the most rated/important websites and information.
    -The members in each group will be able to support other members in the same group by providing important and vital resources. 

#### Use cases:
    -This can be effective for **businesses** who are in need of SBA loans or support and can **rely on other businesses who found certain wesbites/documents beenficial**.
    -This can also be effective for **health care workers** who **rank articles of covid prevention to others** while working in a medical environment. 
    -This can also be effective for **family/friends** who can **share websites with local information about their community** and any areas that have seen an increase in covid cases.
    -This can also be effective for **students** who can **push websites that provide good online learning resources** for home learning.
